#zomato rating prediction and sentimental analysis


The goal of analysing the Zomato dataset is to gain a better understanding of the factors that influence each restaurant's overall rating, as well as the establishment of various types of restaurants in various locations. Bengaluru, for example, has over 12,000 restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. With new restaurants opening every day, the sector hasn't yet reached saturation, and demand is growing by the day. Despite rising demand, new eateries are finding it difficult to compete with established establishments. The majority of them provide the same dishes. Bengaluru is known as India's IT capital.Because they don't have time to prepare, the majority of the people here rely heavily on restaurant meals. With such a high demand for eateries, it's more crucial than ever to research a location's demographics. What type of food is more popular in a given area. Is vegetarian food popular throughout the community? If yes, is that area populated by a particular religious sect, such as the Jain, Marwaris, or Gujaratis, who are generally vegetarians? These types of analyses can be carried out using data and the examination of various elements.
